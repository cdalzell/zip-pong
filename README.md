## "Zip Pong"

Nothing to see here, just playing around with d3.. Poorly.. :D

How to run locally:
```
> npm install
...
> node server.js
```

Then just point your browser at localhost:8080

Or you can see whatever the last thing I pushed to GitHub pages is by shoving this up your browser: [https://cdalzell.github.io/zip-pong/]..
